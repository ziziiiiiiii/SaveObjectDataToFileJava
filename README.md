This project was made for CS 112, Fundamentals of Programming 2, at Allan Hancock College. It is written in Java. It takes hard-coded information, in this case a name, account number, balance, and whether or not the account can issue checks, and stores it in an object. It then outputs that object to a .dat file with a name chosen by the user.

Demo must be run by the user which calls Person.
